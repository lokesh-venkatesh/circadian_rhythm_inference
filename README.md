This is a reconstruction of the Variational Autoencoder model on 50 years of hourly temperature data by David Kyle in his [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/vae-for-time-series-1dc0fef4bffa/).

This was done in part to come up with a pipeline for inferring phase from circadian rhythm actimetry datasets from patient data. I would then take the learnt representations from the bottleneck layer and run a dimensionality reduction algorithm on those vector representations, and finally perform a clustering on those reduced vectors. This would be followed by an analysis of what variables of the simulated multivariate time series dataset would be most significant in influencing the learnt representations. I also spent an extended amount of time trying to figure out how would convolutions be beneficial, if at all, in comparison to feed-forward neurons in the encoder-decoder architectures. 

I also implemented a few other algorithms like the TSMixer, TimeMAE, and so on, although the code for them hasn't been updated in this repository yet. This will be done soon once I run these algorithms on the actual datasets.
