This is a reconstruction of the Variational Autoencoder model on 50 years of hourly temperature data by David Kyle in his [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/vae-for-time-series-1dc0fef4bffa/).

I have stuck to the same architecture that David Kyle did. It consists of 5 convolutional layers in the encoder, and 5 mirroring deconvolutional layers in the decoder. The latent space is fitted to a seasonal prior distribution.

I also further analysed the vectors obtained after passing the original time-series vectors through the model, by flattening them from 16 dimensions x 10 features into 160 components. I tried PCA as well as t-SNE, the plots for which may be found in the [images](images) folder in this repo. The circular distribution seen in the PCA and the t-SNE (3-D) plots is indeed indicative of time of year, as represented by the colour scheme followed which is supposed to represent day of year as a fraction of 365, and the largest principal component corresponds to an axis representing mean temperature, points for which have been coloured in a coolwarm colourscheme indicating how high or low the average temperature across several days is according to the model.

I have not tried varying the latent dimension since I need to think about how that might affect the representation in the latent space and these features, so that is one angle to further explore. Another line to explore is also to try clustering methods and see if we can fit each of these vectors into unique clusters. I also need to think about other ways to use these vectors instead of simply flattening them, maybe perhaps aggregating them along one of the two axis, or treating the matrix as a whole, although that would make it much more complicated to derive trends.
